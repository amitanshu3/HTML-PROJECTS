            <p>I am a passionate and motivated individual eager to kickstart my career as a Software Development Engineer (SDE). As a recent graduate in computer science, I have gained a solid foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and data structures. My enthusiasm for technology and problem-solving drives me to constantly learn and adapt to new challenges. During my academic journey, I actively participated in various coding competitions and hackathons, which allowed me to sharpen my coding skills and think creatively under pressure. I am comfortable working with multiple programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and frameworks. Collaboration is a value I hold dearly. I believe that great ideas and solutions are often born out of effective teamwork and diverse perspectives. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can exchange knowledge and ideas with fellow developers, learning from their experiences and contributing my own unique insights. My curiosity extends beyond the realm of computer science. I am an avid problem solver, always seeking opportunities to tackle real-world challenges. I have a keen interest in leveraging technology to make a positive impact on society. Whether it's through developing efficient software solutions or embracing innovation, I am passionate about creating meaningful change through technology</p>
